A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape from it. 
This immense gravitational pull occurs because a large amount of mass has been compressed into an extremely small area. 
Black holes are often formed when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycles. The boundary around a black hole 
is called the event horizon—once something crosses it, it can never return. Although black holes are invisible by nature,
scientists detect them by observing the effects they have on nearby stars and light.

There are different types of black holes, ranging from stellar black holes (formed from collapsing stars) to supermassive black holes,
which exist at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way. These can be millions to billions of times more massive than our
sun. Black holes can also merge with each other, releasing powerful gravitational waves that can now be detected by instruments like LIGO.
Despite decades of study, black holes remain one of the most mysterious and intriguing phenomena in astrophysics, raising questions
about the nature of space, time, and the limits of human understanding.
